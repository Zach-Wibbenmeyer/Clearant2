This repository was for a very basic coding test I had to submit for my internship at Clearent, LLC in Saint Louis, MO
I interned at Clearent from June 1, 2016 to August 26, 2016.
The purpose of this coding test was to integrate SOLID and Test Driven Development programming principles to construct
a very basic credit card system.
